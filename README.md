# CodeBuddies - A Pair Programming Platform

CodeBuddies is a collaborative platform designed to facilitate pair programming sessions. The application allows users to connect in real-time, with features for video/audio calls, a shared code editor, and session recording, making it ideal for remote development, mentoring, and onboarding processes.

## Features Overview

- **Video and Audio Call**  
  Users can establish a video/audio call, allowing each user to see and hear each other through their webcams and microphones.

- **Shared Code Editor**  
  The platform offers a collaborative code editor, where edits by one user are reflected instantly on the otherâ€™s screen, creating a real-time, synchronized coding experience.

- **Session Recording**  
  Sessions can be recorded (feature to be fully implemented) for later review, with the video and code changes saved for reference.

## Key Features
